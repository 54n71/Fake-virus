Hi 
Before you hate this post, I know it is not a virus. It's just a bat file (and yes , i use the google traductor because i only know the basic english)

You can "camouflage" it in any way but I leave it to you to do it to your liking

The texts of the file are in Spanish, if you want it in English simply replace the text by doing:

Select the bat file
Right click 
and click edit
Now go to 

"
echo X=MsgBox("Su equipo esta infectado",0+48,"Windows") >> notvi.vbs
echo X=MsgBox("Le recomendamos que..",0+48,"Windows") >> notvi.vbs
echo X=MsgBox("No confies en nadie",0+48,"%username% ") >> notvi.vbs
echo X=MsgBox("Jajajaja %username% , alto nombre de virgen ",0+48,"Created By 54n71") >> notvi.vbs
"

and chage it with
"
echo X=MsgBox("Your vomputer have a virus",0+48,"Windows") >> notvi.vbs
echo X=MsgBox("We recommend",0+48,"Windows") >> notvi.vbs
echo X=MsgBox("Trust nobody",0+48,"%username% ") >> notvi.vbs
echo X=MsgBox("hahahaha %username% , The most virgin name that I saw in my life ",0+48,"Created By 54n71") >> notvi.vbs
"
